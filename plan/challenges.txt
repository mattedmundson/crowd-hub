DAILY CHALLENGE APP: RESEARCH-BASED DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
  1. Focus on consistency over perfection - research shows missing one day doesn't derail habit formation
  2. Design for 60+ day commitment timeline (median 66 days, range 18-254 days)
  3. 
  4. Include regular reflection and review components
  5. Prioritize contextual cues and consistent timing over rigid daily requirements

WEEKLY STRUCTURE RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Hybrid approach: 5 Challenge days (Monday - Friday)
  2. Fixed review day (e.g., Sunday) regardless of weekly completion status
  3. Allow 'catch-up' challenges during review periods without penalty
  4. Track total completion (e.g., 70/70 challenges) rather than perfect daily streaks
  5. Implement 'minimum viable goal' concept - something is better than nothing

MISSED DAYS STRATEGY:
  1. No penalty for single missed days (research supports this)
  2. The aim is to complete all of the challenges. You will do challenges Monday - Friday. Then, if you miss Wednesday, (challenge 3) then that challenge moves to Thursday. The challenge is not set to a specific day. What's important is that you complete all challenges. Say, 70 challenges are normally done in 10-14 weeks rather than saying it has to be done according to the exact schedule. 
  3. Focus message on 'getting back on track' rather than 'starting over'
  4. 
  5. Show progress toward total goal rather than emphasizing consecutive days

REVIEW DAY IMPLEMENTATION:
  1. Weekly reflection prompts: What did you learn? What was challenging?
  2. Progress visualization: show completed challenges and patterns
  3. Planning ahead: set intentions for the coming week
  4. Optional social sharing of insights and progress
  5. Celebrate weekly wins regardless of perfect completion

PSYCHOLOGY-BASED FEATURES:
  1. Habit stacking: attach challenges to existing routines. For christians (who this app is aimed at) - this will make the most sense with morning devotions, or lunch breaks etc. 
  2. Progress visualization that emphasizes cumulative achievement
  3. Positive reinforcement for any completion (not just perfect days)
  4. Community support and social accountability options
  5. Personalized difficulty adjustment based on success patterns

SPECIFIC ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION:
========================================

Based on extensive research, here's the optimal structure for your challenge app:

ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE:
   â€¢ 5 challenge days per week (mon - Fri)
   â€¢ 1 fixed review day (e.g., every Sunday)
   â€¢ Total goal: Complete X challenges over Y weeks (not perfect daily completion)

ðŸ“ HANDLING MISSED DAYS:
   â€¢ Missing 1-2 days per week has minimal impact on habit formation
   â€¢ Focus on 'getting back on track' messaging, not restarting
   â€¢ Offer mini-challenges (2-5 min) for recovery days
   â€¢ Track cumulative progress toward total goal

ðŸ”„ REVIEW DAY STRUCTURE:
   â€¢ Fixed day regardless of weekly completion
   â€¢ Reflect on learnings and patterns
   â€¢ Plan upcoming week
   â€¢ Celebrate any progress made

â­ KEY INSIGHT:
   Research shows consistency matters more than perfection.
   Design for flexibility while maintaining structure and accountability.
