# Challenge App - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

The Challenge App is a white-label spiritual growth platform that enables churches and organizations to guide their communities through structured personal development journeys. The platform combines daily challenges, guided journaling, and progress tracking in a single, beautifully designed application that respects user privacy while fostering community engagement.

**Problem Statement:** Churches and individuals currently use multiple fragmented tools for spiritual growth activities, leading to low engagement and inconsistent practice. There's no unified platform that combines structured challenges with personal reflection while maintaining the privacy and flexibility users need.

**Target Market:** Primary focus on small to medium churches (50-1000 members) seeking to enhance congregation engagement in spiritual practices. Secondary markets include corporate wellness programs and personal coaching practices.

**Key Value Proposition:** All-in-one platform that reduces app fatigue by combining challenges, journaling, and future course content in a single, beautiful interface that inspires daily use.
